# React-SSR-E-Commerce

#### Demo https://react-ecommerce-app-ssr.herokuapp.com/

### Note: add your MongoDB URI and stripe credentials in the config file

this is not a production ready web app, i built this just for fun, if your looking for production ready web app a lot of improvement is needed, but you can start from here and then add features according to your need. 

#### some of improvement that i can think of
##### handling error in the checkout page, 
##### adding sku for each product,
##### adding size and stock quantity for each color, 
##### structuring the database in a better way to handle your needs, 
##### creating a collection for coupon, 
##### most important adding login system with authentication
